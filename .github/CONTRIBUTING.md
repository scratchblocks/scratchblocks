Hello!
Thanks for your interest in contributing to scratchblocks.

The [Community Guidelines](https://github.com/scratchfoundation/scratch-www/wiki/Community-Guidelines) for **[scratch-www](https://github.com/scratchfoundation/scratch-www)** also apply here. :-)

In particular, although this code is used on the Scratch website, it's not maintained by the Scratch Team. So please remember developing this isn't our job!

When **reporting an issue**, please do the following:

* Read [the **syntax guide**](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Block_Plugin/Syntax)
* Use **code examples** and links to <https://scratchblocks.github.io/>, where relevant
* Provide **screenshots**/comparison with Scratch, where relevant

---

For **pull requests**:

* When developing, you need to run a local web server:

    ```
    npm start
    ```

* Browse to <http://localhost:8000/> to access the development version.

To modify the homepage, send a PR to the [scratchblocks/scratchblocks.github.io](https://github.com/scratchblocks/scratchblocks.github.io) repo.

When **running locally**:

You can optionally put a file `screenshot.png` in the root of the repository. This will be overlaid against the output from Scratchblocks, to spot differences in layout and pixel alignment. Click and drag with the mouse to fine-tune the alignment vertically. Hold modifier keys like Ctrl, Shift, or Alt to adjust the transparency of the overlay.
